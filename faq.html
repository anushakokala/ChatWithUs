                            Participating in hackathons, getting involved in clubs, and working on side projects are the best way to get
                            more experience! Furthermore, these activities can be put on a resume to help you land an internship, which can
                            help you work with real-world problems in your career field.

                            Absolutely! Networking helps you get your name out there for potential recruiters and builds your reputation.
                            Additionally, networking enables you to gain mentors and other peers who can help you gain more opportunities.

                            You donâ€™t need to have any prior experience programming before starting college! You learn the fundamentals in
                            your introductory courses, and you will learn a language as you progress through these courses.

                    Is it better to focus more on your academics or your extracurriculars as a freshman?

                            Both are equally important! Having a strong GPA throughout college can ensure a timely graduation.
                            However, while a good GPA is impressive, try to also participate in extracurriculars.
                            Extracurriculars teach important skills you may not learn in a traditional classroom setting.
